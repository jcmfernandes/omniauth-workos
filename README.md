# OmniAuth WorkOS Strategy

An OmniAuth strategy for authenticating with [WorkOS](https://workos.com). This strategy is based on the [OmniAuth OAuth2 strategy](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-oauth2).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-workos'
```

If you're using this strategy with Rails, also add the following for CSRF protection:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

To start processing authentication requests, the following steps must be performed:

1. Initialize the strategy
2. Configure the callback controller
3. Add the required routes
4. Trigger an authentication request

### Authentication hash

The WorkOS strategy will provide the standard OmniAuth hash attributes:

- `:provider` - the name of the strategy, in this case `workos`
- `:uid` - the user identifier
- `:info` - the user's profile ([can be filtered](#filter-info-fields))
- `:credentials` - token requested and data

```ruby
{
  :provider => "workos",
  :uid => "prof_01DMC79VCBZ0NY2099737PSVF1",
  :info => {
    :connection_id => "conn_01E4ZCR3C56J083X43JQXF3JK5",
    :organization_id => "org_01EHWNCE74X7JSDV0X3SZ3KJNY",
    :connection_type => "okta",
    :email => "todd@foo-corp.com",
    :name => "Todd Rundgren",
    :first_name => "Todd",
    :idp_id => "00u1a0ufowBJlzPlk357",
    :last_name => "Rundgren",
    :object => "profile",
    :raw_attributes" => {...}
  },
  :credentials => {
    :token => "ACCESS_TOKEN",
    :expires_at => 1485373937,
    :expires => true
  }
}
```

#### Filter info fields

To filter the fields in the `info` object, you can specify them when you register the provider:

```ruby
provider
  :workos,
  ENV['WORKOS_CLIENT_ID'],
  ENV['WORKOS_CLIENT_SECRET'],
  ENV['WORKOS_DOMAIN'],
  {
    info_fields: %w[email first_name]
  }
```

Possible values are:
- `"all"` (default) - don't filter, that is, include all fields
- `%w[...]` (an array of **strings**) - the fields to include

Note: field `"name"` will always be included.

### Query parameter options

In some scenarios, you may need to pass specific query parameters to `/sso/authorize`. The following parameters are available to enable this:

- `connection`
- `organization`
- `provider`
- `login_hint`

Refer to the [documentation](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/authorize/get#authorize-get-endpoint) to see when and how to use them.

Simply pass these query parameters to your OmniAuth redirect endpoint to enable their behavior.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
